User stories for developing this project

User #1: An average movie watcher that wants to pick a movie for the weekend.
As an average movie watcher, I want to be able to quickly search a word and have titles + images of movies with that word in it come up.


User #2: A movie critic.
As a movie critic for a company, my job is to search movies, see their rating and then compare that rating with my own rating after a watch. 


User #3: A mobile user on the go
As a mobile user, I want to quickly search for movies on the go for suggestions of what to watch.



Possible improvements:
1. Change the img alt so that it actually displays movie titles instead of "movie poster" as it will be more accessible to blind users.
2. Add movie IDs as they would be easier to keep track of in a jS array
3. Users will have to provide their own API key to run project properly. You can obtain this key from this website:https://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx
